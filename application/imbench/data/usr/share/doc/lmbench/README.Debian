lmbench for Debian
------------------

The original sources have been changed in order to work in 
pacakged form (they were supposed to work in a single tarball).
Lmbench scripts and binaries have been placed in /usr/lib/lmbench
in order to avoid binary namespace pollution.

I've tried to change all the scripts in order to break the dependencies
in them:
Results are placed at /var/lib/lmbench/results
Scripts are placed at /usr/share/lmbench/scripts/
Binaries are placed at /usr/lib/lmbench/
Temporaries are no longer placed in /usr/tmp but /var/tmp

Warning: some manpages have been removed from the package due to
overlapping with other binary manpages (they take common names like
'clock', 'timing'). If you wish to consult these manpages, until
this issues are fixed, download the source package and go to the 
doc/ subdirectory.

Warning! Warning!: The lmbench-run wrapper script will not run unless
run by root. However, we have not thoroughly tested lmbench code to
see that it does not contain potential damaging scripts. Be careful
when running the benchmark and, if in doubt, create a user/group
which keeps control of the mentioned directories (ie can write in
them) and run the benchmark as that user.
