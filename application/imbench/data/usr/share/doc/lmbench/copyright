Lmbench is distributed under the GNU GPL license, you can
find a copy of this license in a Debian system under the
/usr/share/common-licenses/ directory.

The authors, however, impose several restrictions (shown
below).  Note that these restrictions affect *only* the
distribution of results collected from running lmbench,
and do *not* preclude one from building, modifying or
distributing the lmbench source code or the binaries
resulting from compiling the source code; i.e., the 
*results* of running the benchmarks have restrictions, 
but the *source code* for lmbench is distributed under 
the GPL.
